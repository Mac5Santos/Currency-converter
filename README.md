# Currency Converter
An offline currency converter built with PHP

# Motivation
As a frequent traveller, sometimes you just have to convert currencies on the go without the need for internet.

# Build status
Continuously growing the list of currencies. Currently:

- AUD
- EUR 
- JPY
- PHP
- SGD
- AED
- BHD
- CHF
- CAD
 
# Features and How to use
Simple dropdown selections for the to and from currencies and one input box should do the trick.

# Code Brief
Used a series of If-Else conditional statements to display the correct conversion after submiting the form. Followed the tutorial at Eduonix with some guidance from my bootcamp instructors.
